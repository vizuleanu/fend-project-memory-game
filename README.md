## Installation
This project can be cloned or downloaded from GitHub: https://github.com/vizuleanu/fend-project-memory-game.git

## How To Play
The game starts automatically upon page load. Click through the cards and try to match the cards with identical icons. The point of the game is to match all the cards in the shortest number of moves possible. You can restart the game at any time by pressing the reload button on the top right of the screen.
 
Once all the cards are matched you will be given a star rating based on the number of moves it took to match all the cars.

### Scoring
3 stars = 14 moves or less  
2 stars = 19 moves or less  
1 star = 20 moves or more
